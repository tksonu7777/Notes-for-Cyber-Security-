# Types of Consensus Mechanisms  

1. **Proof of Work (PoW):**  
   - PoW is a common consensus mechanism used by popular cryptocurrency networks such as Bitcoin and Litecoin.  
   - It requires participant nodes to prove that the computational work they submitted is valid.  
   - However, the Bitcoin consensus mechanism is criticized for its high energy consumption and long processing times.  

2. **Proof of Stake (PoS):**  
   - PoS is another widely used consensus mechanism, developed as a low-cost and low-energy alternative to PoW.  
   - It involves allocating the responsibility of proposing and validating new blocks to participant nodes based on the proportion of cryptocurrency they hold (their "stake").
